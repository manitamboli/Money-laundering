Project Title: Smart Money Laundering Detection System
Project Description:
The Smart Money Laundering Detection System is an intelligent software solution designed to identify, monitor, and report suspicious financial activities that may indicate money laundering. The project leverages advanced data analytics, pattern recognition, and machine learning techniques to detect anomalies in transaction data and flag potentially illegal financial behavior.
